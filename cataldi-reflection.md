*What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?*

I was struggling with GitHub a LOT! Especially just getting used to the workflow.

*What concepts were clarified during the GPS?*

GitHub was clarified a lot, but still feel a bit out of water.

*What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?*

One thing I was confused about was how branches would be used if the master branch was changed underneath it.  Jeff (partner) found out that using git rebase 'branchname' was a way to resync the files.
Matt our guide clarified about the urls to the repositories are called **remotes**.

*What still confuses you about Git?*

I'm getting a better feel for it, but just need more practice over the long-run to get used to the ins and outs and more advanced features.


*How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?*

I thought it was pretty groovy B-)!

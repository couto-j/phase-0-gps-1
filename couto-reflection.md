What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

The biggest issue I was struggling with was being able to actually edit markdown files locally rather than adding all of my text through the command line. This was difficult and clunky, but good to know. Matt was actually able to show me a new way of using my terminal via Cloud 9, and it's extremely helpful. Other than that, most of the commands we've been using within Git have been pretty easy to manage. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

I think the reptition was certainly helpful. It's easy to forgot to add and commit all of your changes, including simply creating a file. The idea of branching and pushing those, making sure to properly follow pull request procedures, seeing thing populate on GitHub, and then finally merging/deleting branches for cleanliness where all solidified during this GPS session. It was awesome.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

It was great to talk through the actual workflow, and we figured out how to "rebase" a git branch based on changes made to the master that we wanted to incorporate into any changes made into the branch. It was pretty awesome to figure out based on the natural gist of our conversation.

What still confuses you about Git?

I'm not really sure I'm confused about Git itself; I think it'd be nice to see all of these different functions work outside of a vacuum and in a real-world application to really get a sense of how things work, but I feel much more confident going through the steps now.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

Great! It was nice to work with Matt remotely since we'll both be at the same on-site location. I'm a do now, ask questions later type and Matt likes to make sure to read through everything and check for thoroughness, so it was a great personality mix to make sure we did this well and effectively.
